HELLO EVERYBODY!

This is the testdriver I made so that we can get good practice running the labs.
All you need to do is run:

	./testdriver [your name] [partners name] [lab number]
	
	EXAMPLE:
	./testdriver tyler jake 3

The examples from learning suite can be compared against your code by typing:

	./testdriver [your name] example [labnumber]e

	EXAMPLE:
	./testdriver alex example 1e

The testfiles are expected to be in the testfiles folder
and they must be named:

	proj[lab nubmer][anything else]
	
	EXAMPLE:
	proj13
	proj235john

the executable from your code needs to be in the format:

	[test][lab number]-[your name]
	
	EXAMPLE:
	test1-joey

You may have to type ":qa" a lot to close each test case

Good luck!
